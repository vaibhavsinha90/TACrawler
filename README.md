This multiple scripts included in this repository work to collect data regarding 'ThingsToDo' from TripAdvisor and extract Keywords from them to classify activities using agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. The data was then used to generate 'userVectors' to map 'activityVectors' to them (as in a VSM). This formed a Activity Recommendation System.
